# Data South Wales

## About the user group
Croeso / Welcome to Data South Wales!

This is an open group, aimed at anyone who works with or wants to learn more about data. There will be a leaning towards the Microsoft Data Platform covering all aspects of the Data Platform and areas such as programming languages and development principles. 

It's an informal group aimed at sharing the latest from the industry and providing an environment to network, share knowledge and feed you with pizza!

We held an in person event at the beginning of 2020 at the University of South Wales. We had more than 40 people in attendance which is fantastic for our first event! Once everyone recovered from the shock of lockdown, we moved the group online and ran a few online sessions. After a bit of a break, we're aiming to kick off a few online sessions during the second half of the year with a view of recommencing in-person events in 2021 assuming everything begins to return to normal.

We're keen to get local speakers involved, sharing knowlege and insight from local businesses. If you'd be interested in talking at a future event, please get in touch. Additionally, if there's specific topics you'd like to hear, let us know and we'll try to find a suitable speaker.
